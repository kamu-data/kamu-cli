/// to provide it as a log of changes between current and the previous export.
/// Merge strategies define how to combine the newly-ingested data with the

/// Contract:
/// - Previous data is received in its original form, including all system
///   columns
/// - New data is received in its original form, except event time column, which
///   in case of a snapshot data may be populated with NULL values
/// - Resulting data:
///   - must include operation type and event time columns
///   - event time column may still contain null values if input did not have
///     this column
/// - Sort order after [`MergeStrategy::merge`] is arbitrary and must be
///   restored using [`MergeStrategy::sort_order`] at the end of processing
