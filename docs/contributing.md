# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for considering to contribute! This project is a massive undertaking, so every little bit helps.

We welcome contributors of any skill level - whether you're new to Rust language or to programming in general - we'll be happy to guide you. Start small and build up.

Besides code you can cotribute in many different ways: improving documentation, improving our CI pipelines, or adding more interesting examples.

Before you start working on anything:
1. Consider joining our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/aSpVjWwu) to discuss your ideas
2. Make sure your work has an associated **GitHub issue**, it's assigned to you, and the scope of work was agreed upon with project maintainers (we value your time and really don't like rejecting PRs!)
3. Read the [Developer Guide](developer_guide.md) on setting up your environment
4. Understand the [Licensing Terms](license_faq.md)
