# Summary
Stock market data analysis is one of the problems where time dimension plays a crucial importance and cannot be left out. This example shows how `kamu` and streaming SQL can be used to build your personal trading performance dashboard which is more powerful than what most trading platforms provide. You will learn how to perform aggregations and join temporal stream and the role of watermarks in this process.

# Steps

## Getting Started
To follow this example checkout `kamu-cli` repository and navigate into `examples/trading` sub-directory.

Create a temporary kamu workspace in that folder using:

```sh
$ kamu init
```

You can either follow the example steps below or fast-track through it by running:

```sh
# Add all dataset manifests found in the current directory
$ kamu add . --recursive
$ kamu pull --all
```

## Root Datasets
We will be using two root datasets:
- `com.yahoo.finance.tickers.daily` - contains daily price summaries (candles) of several major tickers.
- `my.trading.transactions` - contains a log of transaction from a fake trading account similar to what you'd get in data export from your trading platform.

Both datasets are sourcing their data from files located in `data/` sub-directory. Once comfortable with this example you can explore sourcing ticker data from external financial APIs (e.g. as name suggests from `finance.yahoo.com`) and using your own trading transaction history.

Let's add the root datasets and ingest data:

```sh
$ kamu add com.yahoo.finance.tickers.daily.yaml my.trading.transactions.yaml
$ kamu pull --all
```

You can verify the result using the SQL shell:

```sql
$ kamu sql
0: kamu> select * from `com.yahoo.finance.tickers.daily` limit 5;
+-------------+------------+---------+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+
| system_time | event_time | symbol  | close_adj  |   close   |   high    |    low    |   open    |     volume      |
+-------------+------------+---------+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+
|     ...     | 2016-01-04 | IPO     | 19.8662    | 20.2800   | 20.6000   | 20.1700   | 20.6000   | 3800.0000       |
|     ...     | 2016-01-04 | SPY     | 183.2916   | 201.0200  | 201.0300  | 198.5900  | 200.4900  | 222353500.0000  |
|     ...     | 2016-01-05 | SPY     | 183.6017   | 201.3600  | 201.9000  | 200.0500  | 201.4000  | 110845800.0000  |
|     ...     | 2016-01-05 | IPO     | 19.8173    | 20.2300   | 20.2800   | 20.2000   | 20.2800   | 4000.0000       |
|     ...     | 2016-01-06 | IPO     | 19.4156    | 19.8200   | 20.0600   | 19.8200   | 19.9700   | 2600.0000       |
+-------------+------------+---------+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+
```

Remember that after adding a dataset from a `yaml` file - `kamu` creates an internal representation of it in the workspace `.kamu` directory, so if you want to make any changes to the dataset you will need to re-add the dataset again after changing the `yaml` file.

```sh
$ kamu delete com.yahoo.finance.tickers.daily
# ... Make changes to the yaml file ...
$ kamu add com.yahoo.finance.tickers.daily.yaml

# Or alternatively
$ kamu add --replace com.yahoo.finance.tickers.daily.yaml
```

## Deriving current holdings from the transaction log
Our first goal will be to visualize the market value of our account. The account's market value can be estimated by multiplying the number of stocks held by their last known ticker price. Of course we aren't as interested in *current* market value as in *dynamics* of how it was changing over time, so we'd want to produce a stream of events telling us the estimated market value at different points in time.

If you look at the `my.trading.transactions` dataset it essentially contains deltas: how many stocks were bought/sold in each transaction, and the settlement amounts going in/out of our cache account. Our first step, therefore, should be obtaining a dataset that can tell us how many stocks *in total* (per symbol) we own. This can be easily achieved by calculating a running cumulative sum over stock quantities bought and sold.

Since this data might be something we can reuse in other calculations - let's create a dedicated derivative dataset for it.

The following listing shows the use of Flink engine and the SQL window functions for enriching all transaction events with cumulative sums of stock quantities and cash put into buying them:

```yaml
apiVersion: 1
kind: DatasetSnapshot
content:
  id: my.trading.holdings
  source:
    kind: derivative
    inputs:
      - my.trading.transactions
    transform:
      kind: sql
      engine: flink
      query: >
        SELECT
          *,
          sum(quantity) over(partition by symbol order by event_time rows unbounded preceding) as cum_quantity,
          sum(settlement) over(partition by symbol order by event_time rows unbounded preceding) as cum_balance
        FROM `my.trading.transactions`
```

Let's create this dataset:

```sh
kamu add my.trading.holdings.yaml
kamu pull my.trading.holdings
```

The result should look something like:

```sql
$ kamu sql
0: kamu> select * from `my.trading.holdings` limit 5;
+-------------+------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| system_time | event_time | symbol  | quantity  |   price   | settlement  | cum_quantity  | cum_balance  |
+-------------+------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-------------+---------------+--------------+
|     ...     | 2016-01-04 | SPY     | 1         | 201.0200  | -201.0200   | 1             | -201.0200    |
|     ...     | 2016-02-01 | SPY     | 1         | 193.6500  | -193.6500   | 2             | -394.6700    |
|     ...     | 2016-03-01 | SPY     | 1         | 198.1100  | -198.1100   | 3             | -592.7800    |
|     ...     | 2016-04-01 | SPY     | 1         | 206.9200  | -206.9200   | 4             | -799.7000    |
|     ...     | 2016-05-02 | SPY     | 1         | 207.9700  | -207.9700   | 5             | -1007.6700   |
+-------------+------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-------------+---------------+--------------+
```

## Calculating current market value of held positions
Now that we have enriched our transaction data with a running total of holding calculating market value should be a matter of joining these value with the ticker price data.

In the non-temporal world we could solve this problem as:

```sql
holdings:              tickers:
+--------+----------+  +--------+----------+
| symbol | quantity |  | symbol | price    |
+--------+----------+  +--------+----------+
| SPY    | 50       |  | SPY    | 257.9700 |
+--------+----------+  +--------+----------+

SELECT
    h.symbol,
    h.quantity,
    h.price as price_unit,
    h.quantity * h.price as price_total
FROM tickers as t
LEFT JOIN holdings as h ON t.symbol = h.symbol
```

In our case, however, we are joining two streams of events, which might be new to many people.

Consider, for example, the following ticker event:

```sql
+-------------+------------+---------+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+
| system_time | event_time | symbol  | close_adj  |   close   |   high    |    low    |   open    |     volume      |
+-------------+------------+---------+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+
|     ...     | 2016-01-06 | IPO     | 19.4156    | 19.8200   | 20.0600   | 19.8200   | 19.9700   | 2600.0000       |
+-------------+------------+---------+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+
```

When we join it with holdings data we would like it to be joined with the holdings event that directly precedes it in the event time space. In our example it would be:

```sql
+-------------+------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| system_time | event_time | symbol  | quantity  |   price   | settlement  | cum_quantity  | cum_balance  |
+-------------+------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-------------+---------------+--------------+
|     ...     | 2016-01-04 | SPY     | 1         | 201.0200  | -201.0200   | 1             | -201.0200    |
+-------------+------------+---------+-----------+-----------+-------------+---------------+--------------+
```

There are two ways to achieve this. We could use **stream-to-stream joins** and describe the tolerance intervals (how far two events can be apart from each other in time) and the "precedes" condition in our join statement. While stream-to-stream joins have valuable applications using them in this case would be too cumbersome. Instead, we can use the **temporal table joins**.

Temporal table joins (see this [great explanation in Apache Flink's blog](https://flink.apache.org/2019/05/14/temporal-tables.html)) take one of the streams and represent it as a three-dimensional table. You can think of it as `holdings` table from the non-temporal example above that hash a third "depth" axis which is `event_time`. When joining to such a table you need to pass in the time argument to tell join to consider the version of the table that would exist at that point in time.

Let's have a look at the `my.trading.holdings.market-value` dataset:

```yaml
apiVersion: 1
kind: DatasetSnapshot
content:
  id: my.trading.holdings.market-value
  source:
    kind: derivative
    inputs:
    - com.yahoo.finance.tickers.daily
    - my.trading.holdings
    transform:
      kind: sql
      engine: flink
      temporalTables:
      - id: my.trading.holdings
        primaryKey:
        - symbol
      query: >
        SELECT
          tickers.`event_time`,
          holdings.`symbol`,
          holdings.`cum_quantity`,
          holdings.`quantity` as `quantity`,
          tickers.`close_adj` * holdings.`cum_quantity` as `market_value`
        FROM
          `com.yahoo.finance.tickers.daily` as tickers,
          LATERAL TABLE (`my.trading.holdings`(tickers.`event_time`)) as holdings
        WHERE tickers.`symbol` = holdings.`symbol`
```

Using `temporalTables` section we instruct the Flink engine to use `my.trading.holdings` event stream to create a temporal table of the same name.

Here's how this three-dimensional table would look like when sliced at different points in time:

```sql
my.trading.holdings:

@ 2016-01-04
+---------+---+---------------+--------------+
| symbol  |...| cum_quantity  | cum_balance  |
+---------+---+---------------+--------------+
| SPY     |   | 1             | -201.0200    |
+---------+---+---------------+--------------+

@ 2016-02-01
+---------+---+---------------+--------------+
| symbol  |...| cum_quantity  | cum_balance  |
+---------+---+---------------+--------------+
| SPY     |   | 2             | -394.6700    |
+---------+---+---------------+--------------+

@ 2016-03-01
+---------+---+---------------+--------------+
| symbol  |...| cum_quantity  | cum_balance  |
+---------+---+---------------+--------------+
| SPY     |   | 3             | -592.7800    |
+---------+---+---------------+--------------+
```

It basically remembers the last observed value of every column grouped by the provided `primaryKey` (`symbol` in our case).

The `LATERAL TABLE (``my.trading.holdings``(tickers.``event_time``)) as holdings` part can be interpreted as us taking every ticker event from `tickers`, indexing the temporal table `my.trading.holdings` at this event's `event_time` and then joining the same event with the resulting (now ordinary two-dimensional) table.

With theory out of the way, time to give this a try:

```sh
$ kamu add my.trading.holdings.market-value.yaml
$ kamu pull my.trading.holdings.market-value
```

To view the results you can use the provided `trading.ipynb` notebook and see the actual graph:

```sh
$ kamu notebook
```

## The role of watermarks
If you look closely at the previous graph you will notice that the last event there is dated `2019-12-02`. This might be surprising because even though our account has stopped actively trading on that date, the ticker data still keeps coming, so we should be seeing the market value change over the course of 2020 and onwards...

Congratulations, you have just stumbled onto one of the most important features that distinguishes stream processing queries from batch processing!

When joining two streams `kamu` and its engines can't make any guesses about how complete the data in your dataset is. The streams you are joining can have vastly different intervals with which data is added. Ticker data might be added daily, while you, as the owner of transactions dataset, might be exporting your trading data semi-regularly, once in a month or two. Therefore when the transaction data stops coming on `Dec 2 2019` it means that `kamu` can't tell whether you are not actively trading any more or you simply forgot to import the recent transaction history. It therefore **pauses the processing** until this ambiguity is resolved (effectively by starting to buffer the ticker data).

The property behind this mechanism is called **watermark**. The watermark is a simple timestamp `T` that tells that with a high probability all events before `T` have already been ingested into the system. You can take a look at your datasets' watermarks using the `log` command:

```sh
$ kamu log my.trading.transactions
Block: 42012470e20e90036b3098da71e1056ce0e561031bc41fa47faa1d1269f93a2e
Date: 2020-09-28 01:36:39.855 UTC
Output.Records: 48
Output.Interval: [2020-09-28T01:36:39.855Z, 2020-09-28T01:36:39.855Z]
Output.Hash: ...
Output.Watermark: 2019-12-02 00:00:00 UTC
...
```

There are two ways to resolve the "no data vs. stale data" ambiguity and advance the watermark:
- **Adding data** - by default `kamu` advances the watermark to the latest observed event time of the stream. This is not always what you want - if your data often arrives late and out of order it might be wise to delay the watermark to maximize the chances that further processing will not have to deal with late data.
- **Advancing watermark manually** - doing this tells `kamu` that we don't expect any data prior to some time `T` to arrive any more.


## Using manual watermarks
Let's put this into practive and tell `kamu` that transaction data is complete as of `2020-09-01`:

```sh
$ kamu pull my.trading.transactions --set-watermark 2020-09-01T00:00:00Z
# As you can see, this commits a watermark-only metadata block
$ kamu log my.trading.transactions
Block: b6bab439fa2f9c5657655cee5f5b4d9c5d7cc3ebf39b1885df2005c8483d0573
Date: 2020-09-28 02:14:51.909 UTC
Output.Watermark: 2020-09-01 00:00:00 UTC
```

You can also use the short-hand forms like:

```sh
$ kamu pull my.trading.transactions --set-watermark '1 month ago'
```

If we now pull the market value dataset we will see new data emitted:

```sh
$ kamu pull my.trading.holdings.market-value --recursive
```

You can now reload the notebook and see that the graph extends to our watermark date.

> Watermarks and many other stream processing concepts make temporal data processing much simpler. Take a minute to imagine how the queries we wrote above would look like in the batch processing form. How many edge cases associated with varying cadences, late and out-of-order arrivals the equivalent batch processing code would have to handle and how error-prone it would be to write.
