    "\n",
    "No matter if you are Blockchain-cautious, Web3-curious, or already own a mansion in the Metaverse - you'll probably agree that the Distributed Ledgers (Blockchains) are quickly becoming **very large sources of various data**. And we really like data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Web 2/3 worlds of data, however, are still very fragmented:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web2 data sits in thousands of silos, in hundreds of different formats, or hidden behind custom JSON APIs which take weeks to integrate. We are still very far from achieving interoperability of data even in the Web2 world alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web3 data from public ledgers, despite being freely available, presents an big challenge in terms of its volumes and non-friendly to Data Science formats. Some projects like [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) and [Dune](https://dune.com/) make it more accessible, but don't offer much help when you want to combine blockchain data with off-chain sources, with any slightly more advanced use case often requiring you to develop your own data ingestion infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data from off-chain sources is very hard to access from blockchain smart contracts, requiring you to go through expensive and cumbersome oracle networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we could solve all of these problems with a **single technology**? Make data overall much more easily **accessible** and **interoperable**, and erase the boundary between **off- and on-chain data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo we will see how `kamu`'s data pipelines can make this possible, allowing you to:\n",
    "- Move data from an to blockchains\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Fun fact:** `kamu` started in 2018 as a huge set of scripts that ingested data from multiple bank, retirement, and investment accounts, unified all currencies, and analyzed the performance of investments over time. This pipeline was so painful to maintain that we started to look for a better, fully autonomous solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",

    "Staking is when you lock up some of your Ethereum as a collateral and to become a validator of ledger transactions.

    "- How did it perform over time compared to other things you invest in?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are so easy to ask, but **so hard to answer**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this demo we will create a personal data pipeline that can not only provide you an answer, but one that can **constantly stay up-to-date**, giving you full awareness of your portfolio's performance.\n",

If we look at the [Rocket Pool smart contract's code](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393#code) we will indeed find these events:\n",

    "The good thing is, whether you're ingesting external data or building processing pipelines with `kamu`, **you only have to do it once**. While data is flowing, your queries will continue to produce **up-to-date results with minimal maintenance effort**.\n",
