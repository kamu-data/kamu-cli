# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Kamu CLI Project

## Code Quality and Linting

This project uses Rust with Clippy for linting and code quality checks. When performing any code analysis, validation, or after making code changes, you should:

1. **Always run Clippy** using `make clippy` to check for linting issues
2. Run Clippy before and after making code changes to ensure no new warnings are introduced
3. If Clippy reports warnings or errors, address them as part of the code changes
4. Use `cargo check` for basic compilation checks when needed
5. The project follows strict linting standards - treat Clippy warnings as errors that need to be fixed

## Code Style
- Follow the project's existing code style and formatting
- The project uses rustfmt for code formatting
- Respect the existing module structure and naming conventions

## Testing
- This project uses `cargo nextest` for running tests
- Run tests with `cargo nextest run` when making changes that could affect functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before considering changes complete

Remember: **Always run `make clippy` as part of your validation process when working with this codebase.**
